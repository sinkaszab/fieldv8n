# Field Validations

## Goals

- Ability to validate a single field vs. object schema.
- Compose & re-compose validations.
- Full asynchronous validation.
- Validate asynchronous values.
- A failing validation is an expected scenario,
  validation error shouldn't be an Exception.
- Separate concrete validators from the core "framework".
- Be simple and flexible.
- All validators should be custom.
