# Field Validation - fieldv8n

## BREAKING CHANGE

**Version 0.2.0 introduces a breaking change.**

## Why did I need an N+1 solution?

When searching for form validators, most solutions focused on Object schema
validation. Also it was hard to find the right mix of features:

- asynchronous validation,
- (ease of creating) custom validators;
- same package for backend and frontend;
- composability, reusability.

I was also seeking for a solution where I can **separate field concerns from form
concerns** for the following reasons:

- Validate a field after user finished typing or jumps to next field, without
  having to be concerned about what happens when other fields get validated
  in the process.
- Cross field dependency where one field is driving what one or more following
  fields will display.
- Dynamically attach fields.
- Create a standalone hook for React components.

Schema validators tend to act as type-checking mechanisms. I am not interested
in a value being a `string` or not, rather is it an email address or not? Yes,
an email address most possibly must be a `string`, but it is a very specialized
one where the `string` type is an implementation detail of it's representation.
And also the input value will come from an HTML `<input>` element where `type=`
will be `text` or `email` that in the end outputs a `string` value. If I need
type-safety I'll go with TypeScript.

## Design

### Full asynchronous validation

Composing/chaining synchronous and asynchronous functions requires the
composition/chain of functions to be asynchronous. This is how JavaScript works:
[What Color is Your Function?](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)

The use cases I was working with almost all the time required to call an API at
some point in the validation chain, where I would use an asynchronously fetched/calulated
result. It would be a hassle to provide sync and async modes.

I would like to provide validation result to the user before she/he leaves the field.
To do that I need to "guess" when the user finished typing and then validate a
maybe partial, maybe complete input value. Maybe the simplest way is to debounce
my input value validations which requires an asynchronous workflow.

Asynchronous functions are based on synchronous ones, so as a superset most
possibly will satisfy future needs, so I will not need a workaround or having
more implementation modes.

### No built-in validators

If I want a flexible validation "framework" it seems essential to separate the
validators from the core framework. And after all, some use cases might need an
ISO compliant email check and others only need to ensure that the user has an
"@" character and maybe one "." after the "@" in her/his email address to verify
intention.

So if I don't check types and cannot define a good set of standard validators,
why even include them in the library? Go write your own validators, create a
package from your commonly used ones. Follow the
[YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)
principle as does the `fieldv8n` design.

#### What should a validator function test?

A chain of validator functions should test the complete input value,
and each validator function should only test one property of it.
Build-up your validations incrementally.

**A very basic example how to validate an email address:**

1. `CONTAINS_AT_CHAR`: On error, inform the user she/he missed to include "@".
2. `DOMAIN_CONTAINS_DOT`: On error, inform the user that the missing dot character
   let's us guess she/he mistyped the domain part.
3. `NO_ILLEGAL_CHARACTER_IN_NAME`: On error, inform user about characters that need
   to be removed form the part before the "@".
4. `NO_ILLEGAL_CHARACTER_IN_DOMAIN`: On error, inform user about characters that
   need to be removed form the part after the "@".

**What not to validate?**

A simple answer to this is: Don't validate anything that can be safely marshaled
away or escaped by some simple operations before validating the data or sending
it to your API.

E.g. don't validate whitespace before and after the email address. Maybe it was
copy-pasted with the surrounding whitespace. Trim the value.

A harder decision is what to do when you encounter space character inside the
email address. Maybe the user wanted to type a different character, maybe not.
A good solution is to make the user verify the email address (by sending
her/him an verification email, where you also provide option for checking the
status of the process.) In this case you can safely remove inner whitespaces.

Another way is to make the user review the address before sending the form. That
way you can separate filling and reading processes for the user, there is a higher
chance errors will be caught and then provide option to correct the fields.
Don't make wild guesses and block the user in her/his interaction with a
doubtful validation error.

You see a "@@@" or ".."? Use marshaling to get rid of multiplicated functional parts.
You don't see into the user's head. If you would, you didn't need to ask for her/his
email address. Again reduce to one "@" or "." and make the user verify the data.

### Tell, don't ask

- You can use an input field without a form tag and still create meaningful functionality.
- A form's role is to send data on user inducted submission as defined by its `method`
  and `action` attributes.
- The form shouldn't care how to validate a field.
- An input field should tell the form if it can send the data.
- An input field shouldn't care when the data is sent. Only tell what is the
  status of the data to be sent.

### Goal

IMHO a successful software should resemble to `*nix` functions like `grep`.
It's small, it has one task which it does well. It only needs little
maintenance, it shall be long-lived and rewrite is a clear sign of failure here.

(Maybe a total rewrite before reaching 1.0.0 can be acceptable ðŸ˜…. TypeScript
was chosen for the rewrite to comply with trends therefore to be able to reach
a wider audience.)

## Install

`fieldv8n` package is compiled with TypeScript, type definitions are included.

```sh
npm i -P fieldv8n
```

## Usage

Using `fieldv8n` is fairly easy. It only has a handful concepts to be understood.

- `fieldv8n` is just a framework for running input field validations, as a
  consequence it doesn't offer any built-in validator functions. Just as test
  frameworks don't offer no test cases for your code.
- You create a validation chain by composing standalone validator functions. Standalone
  validator functions should describe one property of the validated input value.
- Validators can work directly with the input value or be set to accept an initial
  configuration value.

### Validator

A validator contains the domain logic for a property of the to be validated value.
You create a validator by passing a config object to `fieldv8n.validator`.

- A validator needs a name, called `identifier`. An identifier must be all caps,
  can contain underscore, but cannot start or end with and underscore.
  Identifier is a `string`.
- You explicitly have to tell whether this is an initable validator by
  providing the `initable` property.
- Last you need to add an initable or non-initable of your choice `method`.
  If your validator is initable, your method needs to return a function
  on the first call and then accept an input value. **It doesn't matter whether
  the validation takes place synchronously or asynchronously, it will be evaluated
  asynchronously anyway (by the runner).**

```ts
import { validator } from "./fieldv8n";
// import { FinalValidator, InitableValidator } from "./fieldv8n";

const IS_BAZ = validator({
  identifier: "IS_BAZ",
  initable: false,
  method: (x: string) => x === "baz",
}); // as FinalValidator

const CONTAINS = validator({
  identifier: "CONTAINS",
  initable: true,
  method: (a: string) => (b: string): boolean => new RegExp(a).test(b),
}); // as InitableValidator
```

#### Unit test

You can easily unit test your validators. You call `VALIDATOR#validate` or
`VALIDATOR#init` then `VALIDATOR#validate` depending on initable type.

```js
test("your validators", () => {
  expect(IS_BAZ.validate("foo")).toBe(false);

  const CONTAINS_FOO = CONTAINS.init("foo");
  expect(CONTAINS_FOO.validate("foobar").toBe(true);
});
```

TODO: Extend with remaining methods.

## Error (exception) handling

TODO: Add back examples and rewise Exception handling section.

Exception handling is a sensitive topic. However here I think directing both
validation and runtime errors thrown during `.validate()` to a different branch
will help uncover unhandled cases.

Validation and runtime error share a common interface, except when a runtime
error occurs, `runtimeError` property will be present on the `invalidData`
object. From the user's perspective it doesn't matter why a validator is
failing, the most important thing is to notify the user about the failure,
however inconvenient it might be that she/he can never input a valid value.

Runtime errors should be sent to a tracking service.

## What to avoid?

Consumers of the package are discouraged to use *typeof* like type checks. These
information is already hidden by the implementation and you most possibly will
not even have a reason to use them.
